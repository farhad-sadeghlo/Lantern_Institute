This is the health project that I did while studying at Lantern Institute. 

Recently, I have decided to get back to it and make improvements.

In this project we had datasets of sleep, exercise, floors, heart rate, and steps the person have moved.

We were supposed to: 

1. Clean each dataset
2. Adjusting the offset UTC time, if it's applicable
3. Provide separate analysis of each dataset
4. Do further analysis, provide meaningful relations and make a model
5. Show some of the graphs online using plotly and GCP
(as It's a web app with .py python extention provided as another project in plotly-dash folder)

This further update would be provided soon. 

6. Use Machine Learning tools to make models
